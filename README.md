# delay-start

A tiny Rust program to launch a program after a delay. I use this to delay
the start of [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) on my desktop
during boot so that it properly accounts for my display scaling settings.
Without the delay, it renders without scaling which makes everything look super
tiny on my 4K display.
